```sh
npm run build
```

```
what it's going to do is it's going to go through and package up all my code and it's going to create the bundle and optimize the code so it'll do things like minifying the javascript and it will remove any code that i've included that i'm not using so if there's a module that i'm not using it can just remove that it's called tree shaking so it's got a bunch of optimizations that it can make to try and make this thing as small as possible and when it's done so you can see here 
```

```sh
cd build
```

```sh
npx serve
```
or
```sh
npx http-server
```
